Your Spectral Savior: lineid_plot
===============

Info about the lineid_plot module
-------------------------

Recently I was trying to label some lines in spectra- I asked around to a few 
python users and got a few methods. All of them were pretty cumbersome though, and 
required a lot of effort to tailor to my needs. 

I searched around on the internet and found this link:
http://packages.python.org/lineid_plot/
The source code can be found on github as well:
https://github.com/phn/lineid_plot

There are instructions on the page on how to use this handy module that labels
lines on a spectrum. The nice part is you just have to make two lists, one with
your line locations and the label you want for each respective element in the
list. 

I have also included the script (lines.py) I used to generate my spectrum 
with labeled lines as well as the 3 FITS files of the spectra used in the script.
You can see the resultant plot in plot_screenshot.png. 

You have to install the lineid_plot module before you can run my script. Matt 
Davis provided me with this really handy link for installing modules, if you need:
http://stsdas.stsci.edu/configuration.html#python 

Let the labeling begin.

Also, I should note that I am not the creator of this module, only a happy user.
See the github page for author information.
